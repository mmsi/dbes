Version Nomenclature-----
	Versions are represented by positive integers in four fields:
	
						stage
						  of
	major	 minor	 development	revision
	  X   .   XX    .     X       .     X
	  
major number represents milestones (see roadmap below)

minor number represents incremental development between milestones

stage of development represents code maturity: 	0 = alpha
												1 = beta
												2 = rc
												3 = stable (yeah, right)

revison represents bug fixes, trivial cleanups, etc.


Roadmap-----
	Unfortunately this project has changed a lot during the prototype phase and
a software roadmap is difficult to define. But we need some way to track
versions so I'll try. Note: I don't want this roadmap to correlate with code
maturity. It would be nice if each milestone went through a feature freeze and
stabilization before tearing everything apart and rebuilding(see line 20 above).
So here it goes.

Major 1: The most basic of functions working and robust. Since this is a mission
critical system, reliability far overshadows ease of use and a wide range of
features.
-jumpered manual operation
-networking
-a simple user interface over the serial port to a laptop
-automatic (minimal fault checking)

Major 2: Full safety and reliablity features
-full per-slave prediction and fault checking
-full master fault checking and reporting
-enhanced laptop UI, ncurses or gtk (requires remote application, which would be
	good to offload processing and complexity from the master jack)
-
